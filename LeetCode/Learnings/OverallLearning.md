# Learnings

## 1. 2 pointers approach. 

### When to use?

### What?
Slow and fast pointer approach

## 2. Try to break down the problem and draw a rough sketch of the problem decomposition
### Examples
Product Of Array except Self is easier to solve if we draw the solution and can see the Left and the Right array.

### Using Dictionary

* Remember to check for Duplicates in Dictionary while Adding, Also check if the Key exists before retrieving,
 Otherwise exception is thrown

### Use Doubly Linked list when fast Deletion and insertion is required of order O(1).

### If problem involves not to change sort order or not moving items, like Finding sum of contiguos numbers, then Dynamic Programming may help.

### A integer from 0-9, which is represented as a char, e.g. '9' can be converted to number by substracting the Char with '0'. This works as the substraction is carried
out for the unicode and difference is returned. This is helpful in the problems where a number is given as a string and we need to perform operations on 
the digits like finding minimum number or maximum number.

* Recursive Solutions use more space.
* Iterative solutions may use less space than the recursive solutions.
