         * Question: 
         * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

            Example:

            Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
            Output: 6
            Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

            Follow up:

            If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

         * 1. Iterate over the array.
         * 2. Store the Sum as first element
         * 3. If current Number is less than zero, then Skip and move to next, and Reset sum.
         * 4.
